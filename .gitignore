# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# Temporary files generated by your text editor or operating system
# belong in git's global ignore instead:
# `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` or `~/.config/git/ignore`

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files.
/.env*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# TODO Comment out this rule if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/master.key

# Only include if you have production secrets in this file, which is no longer a Rails default
# config/secrets.yml

# dotenv, dotenv-rails
# TODO Comment out these rules if environment variables can be committed
.env
.env*.local

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
/tmp/storage/*
!/tmp/storage/
!/tmp/storage/.keep

/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
